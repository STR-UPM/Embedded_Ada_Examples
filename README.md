### Contents

This repository contains examples of software for embedded systems written in Ada. Examples are available for some STM32F4 boards.

You will need a GNAT cross compiler for the board you are using. Free compilers can be downloaded from the [AdaCore Community site](https://www.adacore.com/community).

The examples have been compiled and tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 x86 host. MacOS and Windows host can also be used.

See the specific folders to read more about setting up the programming environment for different target platforms.
