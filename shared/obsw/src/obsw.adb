with Last_Chance_Handler;  pragma Unreferenced (Last_Chance_Handler);

with Housekeeping;  pragma Unreferenced (Housekeeping);
--  The Housekeeping subsystem reads sensors and puts values in a store.

--  with Basic_TM;      pragma Unreferenced (Basic_TM);
--  --  The Basic_TM package contains the task that generates

--  --  The HK_TM package contains the task that generates
--  --  housekeeping telemetry messages that are sent to the ground station.

--  --  The TC_Receiver package contains the task that receives TC messages
--  --  from the ground station and decodes them.

--
--  --  Although these packages are not referenced directly in the main procedure,
--  --  we need them in the closure of the context clauses so that
