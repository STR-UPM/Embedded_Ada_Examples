--  This is the main procedure for the toy_obdh example.

with Housekeeping;  pragma Unreferenced (Housekeeping);
--  The Housekeeping subsystem reads sensors and puts values in a store.

with Basic_TM;      pragma Unreferenced (Basic_TM);
--  The Basic_TM package contains the task that generates
--  basic telemetry messages that are sent to the ground station.

with HK_TM;         pragma Unreferenced (HK_TM);
--  The HK_TM package contains the task that generates
--  housekeeping telemetry messages that are sent to the ground station.

with TC_Receiver;   pragma Unreferenced (TC_Receiver);
--  The TC_Receiver package contains the task that receives TC messages
--  from the ground station and decodes them.

--  Although these packages are not referenced directly in the main procedure,
--  we need them in the closure of the context clauses so that
--  they will be included in the executable.
